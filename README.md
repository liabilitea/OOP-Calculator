# OOP-Calculator
***
## Description

This Python project serves as a simple calculator, which allows users to perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses exception handling to deal with any errors or exceptions that may arise during calculations. In case the user inputs invalid values or tries to divide by zero, the program will catch the error and showcase an error message. OOP was utilized in this code to easily customize and modify the UI and incorpotate it with the calculations done by the calculator.

The code executes the calculation in a GUI, which was made by employing the Tkinter library. 

## Files: Summary

- Calculator.py
  > Contains the main algorithm for calculations.

- Calculator_ui.py
  > Contains the code for the user interface incorporated with the Calculator class, as the module was called in this file.

- Main_calculator.py
  > Starts the main event loop for the user interface, enabling its display and interaction with the user.

## How To Use / Run 

1. Install Python on your computer to run the code. You can download its latest version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open an IDE and paste the code from the 3 separate files. Make sure that the files are separated into three, as seen in the repository.
3. Save the files with a .py extension.
4. Run the Main_calculator.py script.
5. A Graphical User Interface will appear, select the operation you want to perform from the dropdown menu.
6. Enter the first number in the "Enter first number" field and the second number in the "Enter second number" field.
7. Click the "Calculate" button, then the result will appear in the "Result" field.
8. After clicking the calculate button, a popup window will appear asking if you want to input numbers and operations again.
9. If you select "Yes", the "Result" field will be erased. If you select "No", the GUI will close.

## Customization

- Calculator UI: Make it more realistic / similar to an actual calculator
- Add more mathematical operations
